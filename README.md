# üöë Health Risk Early Warning System (HREWS)

A comprehensive machine learning-based application that predicts patient health risk levels and provides early warning for potential health deterioration. Built with Python, Streamlit, and advanced ML algorithms.

## üìã Project Overview

The Health Risk Early Warning System (HREWS) is designed to assist healthcare providers in making data-driven decisions by:

## üìä Dataset Information

The system uses a comprehensive dataset with **1,000 patients** and **10 features**:

| Feature | Description | Type |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Patient_ID | Unique anonymized identifier | Categorical |
| Respiratory_Rate | Breaths per minute | Numerical |
| Oxygen_Saturation | Blood oxygen saturation (%) | Numerical |
| O2_Scale | Oxygen therapy scale used | Numerical |
| Systolic_BP | Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) | Numerical |
| Heart_Rate | Heart beats per minute | Numerical |
| Temperature | Body temperature (¬∞C) | Numerical |
| Consciousness | Level of consciousness (A/P/C/V/U) | Categorical |
| On_Oxygen | Patient on supplemental oxygen (0/1) | Binary |
| Risk_Level | Target variable (Normal/Low/Medium/High) | Categorical |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python hrews_model.py
```

This will:
- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Train multiple ML models
- Evaluate performance metrics
- Save the best model as `hrews_model.pkl`

### 3. Launch the Web Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`
